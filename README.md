# Maps-Weather-Distance-Calculator

This XML project in C# calculates the distance between people (Clients & Field Reps) by getting their latitude and longitude values using the Google Web services (SOAP & REST services). Their location (address) is identified using XML, JSON & XPath. Also the temperature, precipitation and humidity of each city where the people are located are computed. The following technologies were used: XML, XSLT, XSD, XPath, SOAP, REST, WCF, UTF-8, JSON, and JavaScript.
