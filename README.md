# Maps-Weather-Distance-Calculator

* This XML project in C# calculates the distance between people (Clients & Field Reps) by getting their latitude and longitude positions using Google web services (SOAP & REST). Their location (address) is identified using XML, JSON & XPath. The temperature, precipitation and humidity of each city where the people are located are also computed. 
* The following technologies are used: XML, XSLT, XSD, XPath, SOAP, REST, WCF, UTF-8, JSON, and JavaScript.
* The Output/UI of the project looks like [this!](https://github.com/Surya-Murali/Maps-Weather-Distance-Calculator/blob/master/UI_Output.jpg)
* The sequence diagrams and project architecture can be found [here.](https://github.com/Surya-Murali/Maps-Weather-Distance-Calculator/tree/master/Sequence%20Diagrams%20%26%20Project%20Architecture)
